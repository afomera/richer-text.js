## How the JS works

RicherText is written with Lit, using the TipTap libraries and extensions with a few of our own added. It's compiled into a web component so getting a Richer Text Editor is a matter of adding `<richer-text-editor></richer-text-editor>` into your HTML after importing the JS package into your entry point.

RicherText is a project by [Andrea Fomera](https://afomera.dev). It's based on [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev), which itself is based on ProseMirror.

_**RicherText is not looking to maintain backwards compatibility with ActionText**. For a compatible editor, take a look at [Rhino Editor](http://rhino-editor.vercel.app)._

The editor itself is written in React, and converted into a Web Component for ease of including in any project.

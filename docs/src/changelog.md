## 0.17.0

- Added support for oEmbed embeds by adding an `oembed` attribute to the editor, when passing it as true, the editor will look at `embedsPath/patterns` to load the oembed patterns in, and POST to the `embedsPath` endpoint when the users chooses to Embed instead. For more details checkout our oEmbed documentation.

## 0.16.0

- Introduce Custom Embeds extension. For more information check the documentation <a href="/ruby-on-rails/embeds">here</a>.

---

## 0.15.0

- Introduce Custom Suggestion extension, this can be used to add functionality like saved/canned replies, liquid variable completion and more. The editor will fetch a provided JSON endpoint for each configuration of the custom suggestions extension, and allow filtering through the list. Then when the user selects one, it will insert the "content" attribute returned for that item from the JSON endpoint.

  Configuring your editor instance is a matter of adding a `custom-suggestions` attribute and passing it a JSON array of objects configured in the following format:

  ```json
  [
    { "name": "savedReplies", "trigger": "!", "path": "/saved_replies.json" },
    {
      "name": "liquidCompletions",
      "trigger": "{{",
      "path": "/liquid_completions.json"
    }
  ]
  ```

  Name should be a unique name across Richer Texts extensions and other types of custom suggestions. Trigger is the character(s) that the user types before the popup will start searching. Path is a relative URL path to the endpoint returning JSON in the following format

  ```json
  [
    {
      "label": "Hello world",
      "content": "<a href='https://i.pravatar.cc/64?img=1'>Link</a>"
    },
    {
      "label": "Something else",
      "content": "<p>Hello world from Snippets.json</p>"
    }
  ]
  ```

---

## 0.14.0

- Introduce a new Mention extension for @mentions support. To use read below:

  - Create an endpoint that returns json in the following format:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "label": "John Doe",
      "id": "gid://app/User/1",
      "avatarUrl": "https://i.pravatar.cc/64?img=1"
    },
    {
      "label": "Jane Doe",
      "id": "gid://app/User/2",
      "avatarUrl": "https://i.pravatar.cc/64?img=5"
    }
  ]
  ```

  - Pass the relative path to the `richer-text-editor` tag by passing `mentionable-users-path` with the URL path of the json endpoint. For example if the users.json endpoint lived at your app root you should pass "/users.json".
  - The endpoint can receive a "query" param with the search term from the user as they type after the @. So typing @John would send a query param of "John".
  - If you're using our `richer_text` Rails gem, you'll need to return Global IDs like so `user.to_global_id.to_s` so we can properly identify the user on the backend.

---

## 0.13.0

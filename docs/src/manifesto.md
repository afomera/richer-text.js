**It's time for a modern text editor.**

For many applications, Trix, first released in 2015 from Basecamp served us well in the Ruby on Rails community and it brought a rich text era into text editors. However, much has changed in the last almost 10 years since the initial release of Trix (that we could find).

However, Trix still requires significant wizardry and technical know-how to extend in 2024 and has limited built-in support for things like multiple heading sizes, text alignment, tables, @mentions and more.

But what if there was an editor built for 2024 and beyond that could be extended in hours not days? Something that had batteries included in the box.

That's it, that's the mission -- the goal.

**Meet Richer Text**

Richer Text accomplishes this goal by using TipTap and ProseMirror under the hood, both are headless abstractions ontop of contenteditable and provide a decent developer experience for creating modern text editors. With Richer Text, we've taken steps to build a new editor that's drop-in ready for applications in 2024, but also extendable to add functionality you've dreamed of adding for years.

You'll find a modern UX where there's a bubble menu and slash commands (we call it a Command Menu) to speed up your users writing experiences. Multiple heading sizes for ultimate flexibility, text alignment, tables, @mentions and more. Additionally it comes with a pleasing UI out of the box and the ability to change the toolbar to how your app desires things to look.

We've built Richer Text for the modern era, with support for [Rhino Editor](https://rhino-editor.vercel.app)'s output as well, it's a total front-end and backend solution for creating, storing and rendering Rich Text.

The modern era for Richer Text editing is here, try it out today and you won't look back.
